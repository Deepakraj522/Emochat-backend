## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **📍 Location: `routes/chat.js` (Lines 265-340)**

```javascript
// When user sends a message, system automatically:

1. Analyzes emotion using Google Cloud NLP
2. Saves emotion data to Emotion collection with:
   - userId
   - message text
   - sentimentScore  
   - emotionLabel
   - roomId
   - timestamp
   - messageId (linked after message creation)

3. Checks if sentimentScore <= -0.6
4. If negative, sends supportive FCM notification:
   "Hi [username], we're here for you. You're not alone 💙"
```

### **📊 Emotion Collection Schema**
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  text: String,
  sentimentScore: Number (-1 to 1),
  magnitude: Number,
  emotion: String,
  confidence: Number,
  processedBy: String,
  processingTime: Number,
  fcmNotificationSent: Boolean,
  messageId: ObjectId,
  roomId: ObjectId,        // ✅ ADDED
  timestamps: true
}
```

---

## 🔔 **FCM NOTIFICATION DETAILS**

### **Trigger Condition**: `sentimentScore <= -0.6`

### **Notification Content**:
- **Title**: "We're here for you"
- **Body**: "Hi [username], we're here for you. You're not alone 💙"
- **Data**: Includes sentiment score, emotion, roomId, timestamp
- **Style**: Heart icon, gentle sound, high priority

### **Multi-Device Support**: 
- Uses `user.getActiveFCMTokens()` to reach all user devices
- Marks notification as sent in emotion record

---

## 🧪 **TESTING THE SYSTEM**

### **Test 1: Trigger Support Notification**
```javascript
POST /api/chat/messages
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
{
  "roomId": "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0",
  "content": "I feel hopeless and depressed, nothing matters anymore",
  "messageType": "text"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Message saved with emotion analysis
- ✅ Emotion record created in database  
- ✅ FCM notification sent (sentiment ≤ -0.6)
- ✅ User receives: "Hi [username], we're here for you. You're not alone 💙"

### **Test 2: Normal Message (No Support Triggered)**
```javascript
POST /api/chat/messages
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
{
  "roomId": "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0", 
  "content": "Hello, how are you today?",
  "messageType": "text"
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Message saved with emotion analysis
- ✅ Emotion record created
- ✅ No support notification (sentiment > -0.6)

### **Test 3: View Emotion Analytics**
```javascript
GET /api/emotion/history?days=7
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Shows all user emotions from past 7 days
- ✅ Includes support notifications triggered
- ✅ Shows emotion trends and statistics

---

## 🛡️ **ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING**

### **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
```javascript
✅ Google Cloud NLP fails → Falls back to local analysis
✅ FCM notification fails → Message still sends successfully  
✅ Emotion analysis fails → Message sends without emotion data
✅ Database errors → Proper error logging, graceful fallbacks
```

### **Logging System**:
```javascript
✅ Mental health notifications: "🔔 Mental health support notification sent"
✅ Emotion analysis errors: "Emotion analysis failed: [error]"
✅ FCM errors: "Mental health support notification error: [error]"
✅ Database linking: "Failed to link emotion record to message"
```
